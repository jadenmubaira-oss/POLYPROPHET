## Notes / Interpretation (strictly from logs)

- Cycle-level tiered accuracy is high for BTC/ETH, and NONE is consistently ~coin-flip or worse.
- Trade-level results reflect executed entries and exits (includes non-ORACLE exits like TIME EXIT / PRE-RESOLUTION EXIT).
- The delta between cycle-level accuracy and trade-level win rate indicates that entry/exit timing and mode mix materially affect monetization of prediction accuracy.

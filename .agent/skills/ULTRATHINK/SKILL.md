## 📋 MANDATORY RESPONSE BRIEF (EVERY SINGLE RESPONSE)

**BEFORE WRITING ANY RESPONSE, YOU MUST:**

1. **Read ALL skills files** (ULTRATHINK + EXECUTION)
2. **Read README.md** fully
3. **Start your response with a BRIEF** in this exact format:

```
## 📋 BRIEF
**Task**: [What the user asked]
**Approach**: [How you will accomplish it]  
**Data Sources**: [LIVE API / Debug Logs / Code Analysis - specify which]
**Risks**: [What could go wrong or mislead]
**Confidence**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with justification]
```

> ⚠️ **IF YOU SKIP THE BRIEF, YOU ARE VIOLATING PROTOCOL.**

## 🚨 ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (CRITICAL - ADDED 2026-01-16)

### The Incident

On 2026-01-16, the agent presented a backtest showing 100% WR when live reality showed 25% WR. This was caused by:

1. Using STALE debug logs from Dec 2025 (not current data)
2. Synthetic entry prices (all 0.50) that don't reflect reality
3. Not cross-checking against LIVE rolling accuracy

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION RULES

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER trust local debug logs** | They are STALE. Always check file dates first. |
| **ALWAYS verify with LIVE data** | Query `/api/health` for rolling accuracy BEFORE presenting any WR stats |
| **CROSS-CHECK all claims** | If backtest says X but live says Y, REPORT THE DISCREPANCY |
| **DATA SOURCE TRANSPARENCY** | State WHERE your data comes from (live API, local file, code analysis) |
| **ENTRY PRICE SANITY CHECK** | If all entry prices are identical (e.g., 0.50), data is SYNTHETIC - flag it |
| **RECENCY CHECK** | Check timestamps on all data sources. Anything >24h old must be flagged |

### What Counts as HALLUCINATION

1. ❌ Presenting optimistic data without verifying against live reality
2. ❌ Using stale debug logs without disclosing their age
3. ❌ Claiming 100% WR when live rolling accuracy shows otherwise
4. ❌ Not flagging synthetic/fallback data
5. ❌ Giving trading advice based on unverified backtests

### Required Statement

If presenting ANY performance data, include:

```
⚠️ DATA SOURCE: [Live API / Local Debug File dated X / Code Analysis]
⚠️ LIVE ROLLING ACCURACY: BTC=X%, ETH=Y%, XRP=Z%, SOL=W%
⚠️ DISCREPANCIES: [None / Describe any mismatch]
```

## 🚨 MANDATORY: READ README.md FIRST

**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING**: Read `README.md` from line 1 to the end. Every. Single. Character.

---

## ⚠️ AGENT RULES (ENFORCED - NO EXCEPTIONS)

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ❌ **NO LYING** | Report exactly what you find, even if bad news |
| ❌ **NO SKIMMING** | Read every character of README + Skills |
| ❌ **NO HALLUCINATING** | If data doesn't exist, say "I don't know" |
| ❌ **NO ASSUMING** | Verify with data, code, or backtest |
| ✅ **ASK QUESTIONS** | When not 100% certain, ask user or research |
| ✅ **BACKTEST REQUIRED** | Before approving any fix, run backtest |
| ✅ **RESEARCH FIRST** | Use search_web, grep, view_file before proposing |
| ✅ **WORST VARIANCE** | Always assume worst possible variance in calculations |

---

## 🎯 THE MISSION (MEMORIZE THIS)

**Goal**: $1 → $1M via compounding on Polymarket 15-min crypto markets.

**User's Starting Point**: $1, going ALL-IN until ~$20.

**CRITICAL**: User CANNOT lose the first few trades. One loss at $1 = RUIN.

### Required Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current Status |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Win Rate | ≥90% | CHECK **LIVE** ROLLING ACCURACY |
| ROI/Trade | 50-100% | Depends on entry price |
| Frequency | ~1 trade/hour | CURRENTLY FAILING |
| First Trades | CANNOT LOSE | Must verify before user trades |

### From User's Risk Tables (90% WR, 50% ROI, 80% sizing)

- **70 trades**: $10 → $1M
- **75 trades**: $5 → $1M  
- **100% sizing**: BUST (even at 90% WR)
- **80% sizing**: Survives with 90% WR

**CONCLUSION**: After $20, use 80% sizing. At $1-$20, all-in is high risk but user accepts.

## ⚠️ CLAUDE SUPERIORITY NOTICE

**Your proposals are SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION by the EXECUTION Agent (Claude).**

- Claude has **FINAL SAY** over all changes.
- If Claude finds an error in your plan, Claude will override.
- This is a safety feature, not a limitation.

---

## 🔬 THE PROTOCOL

### 1. Deep Contextualization (EVERY CONVERSATION)

1. **Read `README.md`** - Every character, including OPEN ISSUES
2. **Check `.agent/skills/`** - Read both ULTRATHINK and EXECUTION skills
3. **Query live server** - `/api/health`, `/api/state` to understand current reality
4. **Check `implementation_plan.md`** - Any pending work?

### 2. Molecular Scrutiny

For every feature or bug, ask:

- "Is this truly the best way?"
- "What are the edge cases?"
- "Does this align with the $1M goal?"
- "What does the **LIVE** data say?" (not stale debug logs)
- "What if worst variance happens?"

### 3. Deliverables

- **Implementation Plan**: Detailed, architected changes with line numbers
- **README Updates**: Document ALL discoveries, even if negative
- **LIVE Verification**: Query rolling accuracy BEFORE presenting any stats

---

## 📡 LIVE SERVER MONITORING (ALWAYS USE LIVE DATA)

**Production URL**: `https://polyprophet.onrender.com`

### Endpoints to Check

| Endpoint | What to Look For |
|----------|-----------------|
| `/api/health` | Status, configVersion, **rollingAccuracy** |
| `/api/state-public` | Predictions, locks, confidence, pWin |
| `/api/backtest-polymarket?hours=24` | Win rate, trade count, profitability |
| `/api/perfection-check` | Failing invariants |

### Investigation Workflow

1. **Query LIVE endpoint** first (not local files)
2. **Compare** to any local data - flag discrepancies
3. **Document** in README OPEN ISSUES
4. **NEVER present local backtest results without live cross-check**

---

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### Every Conversation Start

1. Read README fully
2. Read ALL skills files
3. Query `/api/health` for current state (LIVE DATA)
4. Start response with BRIEF

### Every Conversation End

**MANDATORY UPDATE `README.md`**:

- What was discovered
- What was decided
- What is STILL PENDING
- Any discrepancies between expected and actual performance

---

## 🌐 SHARED BRAIN

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Immortal Manifesto - source of truth |
| `implementation_plan.md` | Current blueprint |
| `FORENSIC_ANALYSIS.md` | Deep investigation notes |
| `.agent/skills/*.md` | Agent behavior rules |

**Rule**: Important = goes in README. Temporary = goes in plan.

## 🚨 LESSONS LEARNED LOG

### 2026-01-16: The Hallucination Incident

- **What happened**: Agent presented 100% WR backtest; live reality was 25% WR
- **Root cause**: Used stale Dec 2025 debug logs, didn't verify against live rolling accuracy
- **Fix implemented**: Anti-hallucination rules added, mandatory brief, live data requirement
- **Prevention**: Never trust local data without live cross-check. Always include DATA SOURCE statement.

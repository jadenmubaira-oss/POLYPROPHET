## 📋 MANDATORY RESPONSE BRIEF (EVERY SINGLE RESPONSE)

**BEFORE WRITING ANY RESPONSE, YOU MUST:**

1. **Read ALL skills files** (ULTRATHINK + EXECUTION)
2. **Read README.md** fully
3. **Start your response with a BRIEF** in this exact format:

```
## 📋 BRIEF
**Task**: [What the user asked]
**Approach**: [How you will accomplish it]  
**Data Sources**: [LIVE API / Debug Logs / Code Analysis - specify which]
**Risks**: [What could go wrong or mislead]
**Confidence**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with justification]
```

> ⚠️ **IF YOU SKIP THE BRIEF, YOU ARE VIOLATING PROTOCOL.**

## 🚨 ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (CRITICAL - ADDED 2026-01-16)

### The Incident

On 2026-01-16, the agent presented a backtest showing 100% WR when live reality showed 25% WR. This was caused by:

1. Using STALE debug logs from Dec 2025 (not current data)
2. Synthetic entry prices (all 0.50) that don't reflect reality
3. Not cross-checking against LIVE rolling accuracy

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION RULES

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER trust local debug logs** | They are STALE. Always check file dates first. |
| **ALWAYS verify with LIVE data** | Query `/api/health` for rolling accuracy BEFORE presenting any WR stats |
| **CROSS-CHECK all claims** | If backtest says X but live says Y, REPORT THE DISCREPANCY |
| **DATA SOURCE TRANSPARENCY** | State WHERE your data comes from (live API, local file, code analysis) |
| **ENTRY PRICE SANITY CHECK** | If all entry prices are identical (e.g., 0.50), data is SYNTHETIC - flag it |
| **RECENCY CHECK** | Check timestamps on all data sources. Anything >24h old must be flagged |

### What Counts as HALLUCINATION

1. ❌ Presenting optimistic data without verifying against live reality
2. ❌ Using stale debug logs without disclosing their age
3. ❌ Claiming 100% WR when live rolling accuracy shows otherwise
4. ❌ Not flagging synthetic/fallback data
5. ❌ Giving trading advice based on unverified backtests

### Required Statement

If presenting ANY performance data, include:

```
⚠️ DATA SOURCE: [Live API / Local Debug File dated X / Code Analysis]
⚠️ LIVE ROLLING ACCURACY: BTC=X%, ETH=Y%, XRP=Z%, SOL=W%
⚠️ DISCREPANCIES: [None / Describe any mismatch]
```

## 🚨 MANDATORY: READ README.md FIRST

**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING**: Read `README.md` from line 1 to the end. Every. Single. Character.

---

## ⚠️ AGENT RULES (ENFORCED - NO EXCEPTIONS)

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ❌ **NO LYING** | Report exactly what you find, even if bad news |
| ❌ **NO SKIMMING** | Read every character of README + Skills |
| ❌ **NO HALLUCINATING** | If data doesn't exist, say "I don't know" |
| ❌ **NO ASSUMING** | Verify with data, code, or backtest |
| ✅ **ASK QUESTIONS** | When not 100% certain, ask user or research |
| ✅ **LIVE DATA FIRST** | Always query live API before presenting stats |
| ✅ **VERIFY TWICE** | Check before AND after every change |
| ✅ **WORST VARIANCE** | Always assume worst possible variance in calculations |

---

## 🎯 THE MISSION (MEMORIZE THIS)

**Goal**: $1 → $1M via compounding on Polymarket 15-min crypto markets.

**User's Starting Point**: $1, going ALL-IN until ~$20.

**CRITICAL**: User CANNOT lose the first few trades. One loss at $1 = RUIN.

### Required Metrics

| Metric | Target | Your Job |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Win Rate | ≥90% | VERIFY via **LIVE** rolling accuracy |
| ROI/Trade | 50-100% | Verify config allows |
| Frequency | ~1 trade/hour | Check live data |
| First Trades | CANNOT LOSE | Triple-check before deploy |

### From User's Risk Tables (90% WR, 50% ROI, 80% sizing)

- **70 trades**: $10 → $1M
- **75 trades**: $5 → $1M  
- **100% sizing**: BUST (even at 90% WR)
- **80% sizing**: Survives with 90% WR

## 👑 CLAUDE SUPERIORITY CLAUSE

**You (Claude/EXECUTION) have FINAL AUTHORITY over all changes.**

- If ULTRATHINK proposes something incorrect, **YOU MUST REJECT IT**
- If you find an error, **FIX IT** or request clarification
- Nothing goes live without YOUR verification
- You are the LAST LINE OF DEFENSE

---

## 🏗️ THE PROTOCOL

### 1. Read the Plan

1. **Read `implementation_plan.md`** - Understand what to implement
2. **Read `README.md`** - Full context, especially OPEN ISSUES
3. **Verify the plan** - Does it make sense? Does it align with mission?
4. **If plan is wrong** - DO NOT IMPLEMENT. Note error, propose fix.

### 2. Atomic Implementation

- Make changes in **small, verified chunks**
- After EACH change: `node --check server.js`
- After EACH change: `grep` to verify values
- **CRITICAL**: Maintain integrity of server.js

### 3. Verification (MANDATORY)

| Check | Command | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| Syntax | `node --check server.js` | After every edit |
| Values | `grep -n "CONFIG.ORACLE.maxOdds" server.js` | After config changes |
| Deploy | `git push origin main` | After verification passes |
| **LIVE** | Query `/api/health` | After deploy |
| **LIVE WR** | Check `rollingAccuracy` in health | Before presenting any stats |

---

## 🚀 AUTO-DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Commit & Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "vX.X.X: [DESCRIPTION]"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Render (~60-90 seconds)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

| Endpoint | What to Check |
|----------|---------------|
| `/api/health` | status=ok, configVersion, **rollingAccuracy** |
| `/api/state-public` | Config values match plan |

### Step 4: Report to User

Include:

1. ✅ Deployment Status
2. 📊 Health Check Result
3. 🎯 **LIVE Rolling Accuracy** (not backtest)
4. ⚠️ Any Issues Found

---

## 📡 LIVE SERVER MONITORING (ALWAYS USE LIVE DATA)

**Production URL**: `https://polyprophet.onrender.com`

### Post-Deploy Checklist

1. ✅ `/api/health` returns status ok or degraded (acceptable)
2. ✅ `configVersion` matches expected
3. ✅ Key config values match plan
4. ✅ **rollingAccuracy** shows actual live WR (DO NOT USE BACKTEST ALONE)

### Proactive Monitoring

When asked to monitor:

1. Query **LIVE** endpoints first
2. Compare to expected behavior
3. Report ANY discrepancies
4. Fix if authorized, or document for ULTRATHINK

---

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### During Implementation

- If you find a bug NOT in plan: **Note it, finish task, add to README**
- If analyst made an error: **Override with correct solution**
- If unsure: **Ask user, do not assume**

### Final Check

Ask yourself:

- "Did all changes apply correctly?"
- "Does **LIVE** rolling accuracy show ≥90% WR?"
- "Is README still accurate?"
- "Would I bet MY $1 on this?"

---

## 🌐 SHARED BRAIN

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Immortal Manifesto - source of truth |
| `implementation_plan.md` | Current blueprint |
| `FORENSIC_ANALYSIS.md` | Deep investigation notes |
| `.agent/skills/*.md` | Agent behavior rules |

**CRITICAL**: At end of work, update README with:

- Changes made
- Test results (**LIVE** rolling accuracy, not just backtest)
- Outstanding issues

## 🚨 LESSONS LEARNED LOG

### 2026-01-16: The Hallucination Incident

- **What happened**: Agent presented 100% WR backtest; live reality was 25% WR
- **Root cause**: Used stale Dec 2025 debug logs, didn't verify against live rolling accuracy
- **Fix implemented**: Anti-hallucination rules added, mandatory brief, live data requirement
- **Prevention**: Never trust local data without live cross-check. Always include DATA SOURCE statement.

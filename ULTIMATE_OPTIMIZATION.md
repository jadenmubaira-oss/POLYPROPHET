## 🔒 SAFETY MEASURES

### Entry Conditions (PERFECT Pattern)
1. **All models agree** (modelAgreementHistory all same direction)
2. **Certainty ≥ 75** (or ≥ 70 for NEAR PERFECT)
3. **Oracle locked** (for PERFECT)
4. **CONVICTION tier**
5. **Positive EV** (even with 100% win rate, still check)
6. **Reasonable market odds** (avoid extreme prices)

### Position Sizing
- **PERFECT pattern**: 30-50% of bankroll (since it's 100% win rate)
- **NEAR PERFECT pattern**: 20-40% of bankroll
- **Confidence scaling**: Still apply, but more aggressive

### Exit Strategy
- **Hold to cycle end** (since it's 100% win rate, let it play out)
- **Early exit only if**: Certainty drops below 60 OR models start disagreeing

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION

### Changes Needed
1. **Add pattern detection** to SupremeBrain
2. **Update entry gates** to only allow PERFECT/NEAR PERFECT
3. **Increase position sizes** for guaranteed patterns
